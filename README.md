# SqlServerProfiler
Sql Server Profiler allows to read *XML exported files from MS SQL Server Profiler *TRC files.

Those trace files can have fields filtered using bash *NEW.XML files.

Those light files can be opened using MS Excel and be saved as *NEW.XLS files.

Sql Server Profiler allows also to read reagular *NEW.XLS result files from Sql queries.

SqlServerProfiler can read *NEW.XLS files into a a data frame to start treatment in R.

This also does the graphics and all for static objects on the data base.

## Some Brief History

R followed S. The S language was conceived by John Chambers, Rick Becker,
Trevor Hastie, Allan Wilks and others at Bell Labs in the mid 1970s. 
S was made publically available in the early 1980's. R, which is modeled closely on S,
was developed by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka in the early 
1990's while they were both faculty members at the University of Auckland. 
R was established as an open source project (www.r-project.org) in 1995. 
Since 1997 the R project has been managed by the R Core Group. 
When AT&T spun of Bell Labs in 1996, S was no longer freely available. 
S-PLUS is a commercial implementation of the S language developed by the 
Insightful corporation which is now sold by TIBCO software Inc.

## How R is organized

R is an interpreted functional language with objects. The core of R language contains the
data manipulation and statistical functions.
Most of R's capabilities are delivered as user contributed packages that may be downloaded from CRAN.
R ships with the "base and recommended" packages:
